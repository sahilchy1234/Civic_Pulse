# 🗺️ Issue Hotspot Map - Feature Guide

## Overview

The **Issue Hotspot Map** is a powerful visualization tool that helps you understand where civic issues are being reported most frequently. It provides three different viewing modes and intelligent filtering to help you identify problem areas and prioritize your response.

---

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Three Visualization Modes**

#### 📌 Markers View
- Shows individual issue locations as colored pins
- Each pin is color-coded by status:
  - **🟡 Yellow (Pending)**: Issues waiting for response
  - **🔵 Blue (In Progress)**: Issues being worked on
  - **🟢 Green (Resolved)**: Completed issues
- Click any marker to see issue details and open full information

#### 🎯 Clusters View
- Groups nearby issues into numbered clusters
- Automatically adjusts based on zoom level
- Shows issue density at a glance
- Click clusters to zoom in and see individual issues
- Perfect for areas with many overlapping reports

#### 🔥 Heatmap View
- Shows issue concentration with color gradients:
  - **🔵 Blue**: Low issue density
  - **🟡 Orange**: Medium issue density
  - **🔴 Red**: High issue density (hotspots!)
- Intensity based on number of issues and upvotes
- Best for identifying problem areas quickly

---

## 🏷️ Status Filtering

### Filter Controls
Use checkboxes to show/hide issues by status:

- **⏳ Pending**: Unchecked = hide all pending issues
- **🔧 In Progress**: Unchecked = hide in-progress issues
- **✅ Resolved**: Unchecked = hide resolved issues

**Use Cases:**
- Focus on unresolved issues by hiding "Resolved"
- See completed work by showing only "Resolved"
- Track active work by showing only "In Progress"

---

## 📊 Real-Time Statistics

The map displays three key metrics:

### 📍 Total Issues
- Total number of issues with location data
- Across all statuses

### 👁️ Visible Issues
- Number of issues currently shown on map
- Changes based on your filters

### 🎯 Hotspot
- Shows the area with most concentrated issues
- Updates based on filtered issues
- Format: "X issues" where X is the count
- Helps identify which area needs most attention

### 4. **Zoom Matters**
- **Zoomed out**: Use clusters or heatmap
- **Zoomed in**: Use markers for detail

### 5. **Click for Details**
Every marker has a popup with:
- Issue title
- Description preview
- Status and upvotes
- "View Details" button for full information

### 6. **Auto-Centering**
Map automatically fits to show all markers when first loaded. Manual pan/zoom is preserved.
