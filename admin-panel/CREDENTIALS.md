## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Strong Password Requirements:
- ✅ At least 12 characters
- ✅ Mix of uppercase and lowercase
- ✅ Include numbers and symbols
- ✅ Don't use common words

### Example Strong Passwords:
- `CivicAdmin@2024!Secure`
- `AdminPanel#2024$Strong`
- `Manage@Issues2024!`

### Recommended Setup:
1. Create unique email for each admin
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Store credentials securely (password manager)
4. Change passwords regularly
5. Remove users who no longer need access

## 📱 Testing Locally First

Before deploying, test locally:

1. Open `admin-panel/public/index.html` in browser
2. Login with the credentials you created
3. Verify everything works
4. Then deploy online!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid email or password"
- ✅ Make sure you created the user in Firebase Authentication first
- ✅ Check for typos in email/password
- ✅ Verify you're using the correct Firebase project

### "User not found"
- ✅ User must be created in Firebase Console first
- ✅ Check you're in the correct project (civicsense-cca11)

### "Too many requests"
- ✅ Firebase rate limiting - wait a few minutes
- ✅ Don't try to login too many times quickly

## 📝 Default Suggested Credentials

For quick setup, use these (remember to create them in Firebase first!):

**Primary Admin:**
```
Email:    admin@civicsense.com
Password: Admin@Civic2024
```

**Alternative Options:**
```
Email:    authority@civicsense.com
Password: Authority@2024

Email:    manager@civicsense.com
Password: Manager@2024
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **These are NOT pre-created** - You must create them in Firebase Console
2. **I cannot create users for you** - Firebase requires manual setup or admin SDK
3. **Change passwords after first login** for security
4. **Don't share credentials publicly** - keep them secure
