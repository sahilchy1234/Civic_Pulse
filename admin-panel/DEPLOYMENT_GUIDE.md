## 📱 Testing Locally

Want to test before deploying? Multiple options:

### Option 1: Direct File Opening
- Just double-click `index.html` (works for most features)

### Option 2: Simple HTTP Server

**Python (usually pre-installed):**
```bash
cd admin-panel
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**Node.js:**
```bash
npx http-server admin-panel -p 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**PHP (if installed):**
```bash
cd admin-panel
php -S localhost:8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Custom Domain**: All hosting services support custom domains (like admin.civicsense.com)
2. **Free SSL**: All mentioned services provide free HTTPS
3. **Updates**: Most services let you redeploy with a single command
4. **Rollbacks**: Services like Netlify and Vercel keep previous versions
