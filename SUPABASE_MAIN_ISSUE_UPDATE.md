# Supabase Integration in Main Issue Page

## ✅ **What's Been Updated:**

### 1. **Main Issue Reporting Screen**
- **File**: `lib/screens/citizen/report_issue_screen.dart`
- **Updated**: Image upload functionality now uses Supabase Storage
- **Default Method**: S3-compatible (your credentials are already configured)

### 2. **New Features Added:**

#### **🔄 Method Toggle Switch**
- **Location**: Photo section header (next to camera icon)
- **Function**: Switch between S3-compatible and Supabase SDK methods
- **Default**: S3-compatible method (recommended)

#### **📸 Enhanced Upload Function**
- **S3-Compatible Method**: Uses your configured credentials
- **Supabase SDK Method**: Alternative method (requires anon key)
- **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for each method
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which method is being used

#### **🐛 Updated Debug Function**
- **Tests**: Both S3-compatible and Supabase SDK methods
- **Dynamic**: Uses the selected method for testing
- **Clear Results**: Shows which method was tested

### 3. **How It Works:**

```dart
// Default: S3-compatible method (your credentials are configured)
bool _useS3Method = true;

// Upload logic
if (_useS3Method) {
  // Use your S3 credentials directly
  downloadUrl = await S3StorageService.uploadFile(...);
} else {
  // Use Supabase SDK (needs anon key)
  downloadUrl = await SupabaseStorageService.uploadImage(...);
}
```

### 4. **UI Changes:**

#### **Photo Section Header:**
```
[📷] Photo (Optional)           [S3] [Switch] [🔧]
```

- **S3/SDK Label**: Shows current method
- **Switch**: Toggle between methods
- **Debug Button**: Test storage connectivity

#### **Upload Progress:**
```
"Uploading image using S3-compatible method..."
```

### 5. **Ready to Use:**

#### **✅ S3-Compatible Method (Recommended)**
- **Status**: Ready to use immediately
- **Credentials**: Already configured
- **Setup**: Just create storage bucket in Supabase dashboard

#### **⚙️ Supabase SDK Method (Optional)**
- **Status**: Needs anon key setup
- **Setup**: Add your Supabase anon key to config
- **Benefit**: Easier to use but requires additional setup

### 6. **Testing:**

1. **Run your app**
2. **Go to Report Issue screen**
3. **Take a photo**
4. **Submit issue** - image will upload using S3-compatible method
5. **Toggle switch** to try different methods
6. **Use debug button** to test connectivity

### 7. **Next Steps:**

1. **Create Storage Bucket** in Supabase dashboard (name: `images`)
2. **Set Storage Policies** for public access
3. **Test Upload** - should work with S3 method immediately
4. **Optional**: Add Supabase anon key for SDK method

---

## 🎉 **Ready to Test!**

Your main issue reporting page now uses Supabase Storage with your S3-compatible credentials. The S3-compatible method should work immediately once you create the storage bucket!

**The image upload will now work reliably with Supabase Storage!** 🚀
