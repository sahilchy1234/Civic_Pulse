## 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**
   - Implement one feature at a time
   - Test with real users
   - Iterate based on feedback

2. **Monitor Costs**
   - Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud
   - Track API usage
   - Optimize based on patterns

3. **Have Fallbacks**
   - If AI fails, let users choose manually
   - Never block user flow
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Measure Impact**
   - Track before/after metrics
   - A/B test features
   - Listen to user feedback

5. **Stay Updated**
   - AI technology evolves fast
   - New models get better/cheaper
   - Keep learning!

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "API Key not working"
- Check API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify billing is set up (required even for free tier)
- Wait 5 minutes after enabling API

### "AI predictions are wrong"
- Adjust `confidenceThreshold` in config
- Add more keywords to category mapping
- Consider training custom model

### "Too slow"
- Use TensorFlow Lite for on-device processing
- Compress images before sending to API
- Cache predictions

### "Too expensive"
- Use TensorFlow Lite (free, offline)
- Implement smart caching
- Only classify when confident needed
